        I'm a self-taught developer who transitioned from criminal justice to
        web development, bringing unique analytical skills and fresh
        perspectives to every project I build. I'm passionate about creating
        <span className="text-white">
          {" "}
          intuitive, efficient web experiences
        </span>{" "}
        and thrive on solving
        <span className="text-blue-500"> complex problems</span> through code.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I'm not programming, you'll find me teaching tennis, scaling rock
        climbing routes, or hanging out with my fianc√©e Bean and our dog Willow
        at local dog parks. My journey proves that with
        <span className="text-blue-500"> dedication and persistence</span>,
        career pivots can lead to exciting new skills and opportunities.
